The data shows that West Germany displayed a considerable level of xenophobia before unification, and that at present, Germans in east and west display strikingly similar patterns of hostility towards foreigners. In comparison to their European neighbours, however, the Germans are not markedly different. In addition to levels of education, and placement on a Left-Right scale, the driving force behind xenophobic attitudes - both in Germany and in other European Community states - are economic and social fears and a perception of relative deprivation.},

  abstract = {Abstract.\hspace{0.6em} This article presents a new model for explaining the emergence of the party family of extreme right-wing populist parties in Western Europe. As the old master frame of the extreme right was rendered impotent by the outcome of the Second World War, it took the innovation of a new, potent master frame before the extreme right was able to break electoral marginalization. Such a master frame \textendash{} combining ethnonationalist xenophobia, based on the doctrine of ethnopluralism, with anti-political-establishment populism \textendash{} evolved in the 1970s, and was made known as a successful frame in connection with the electoral breakthrough of the French Front National in 1984. This event started a process of cross-national diffusion, where embryonic extreme right-wing groups and networks elsewhere adopted the new frame. Hence, the emergence of similar parties, clustered in time (i.e., the birth of a new party family) had less to do with structural factors influencing different political systems in similar ways as with cross-national diffusion of frames. The innovation and diffusion of the new master frame was a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the emergence of extreme right-wing populist parties. In order to complete the model, a short list of different political opportunity structures is added.},

The author makes use of a unique dataset and diffusion models to simultaneously investigate the geographical and temporal development of waves of racist violence in the Netherlands during the turbulent period 2001\textendash{}03, when the country lost its reputation as a multicultural paradise. The results provide evidence for the fact that previous riots enhance the legitimacy of violence elsewhere, especially if they are visible in the mass media, resonate with public debates on immigration and take place in nearby regions. Opposing previous research on mobilization, the analysis suggests that proxies for ethnic competition, deprivation and political opportunity structures are not significantly related to the outbreak of violence; only population size adequately predicts where violence starts. Together these findings suggest that waves of xenophobia develop in two steps: they start in large cities and subsequently spread to nearby places through geographically clustered networks and to more distant counties once they become visible and resonate in the mass media, turning violence from local deviance into a supra-local phenomenon. This process sheds light on how scales of protest shift and explains why seemingly tolerant regions can suddenly become xenophobic hotbeds.},

Even in Southern Europe, usually defined as an area of emigration, the growing number of immigrants has produced waves of xenophobic protest.

The article uses concept and hypotheses developed in research on social movements to analyse mobilization and counter-mobilizations on the issue of immigration in Italy.

Despite the two countries being socio-economically and culturally similar, there are some significant political and structural differences which help to explain why immigration has played a much more prominent role in Danish politics compared to Swedish politics. The article argues that this can be explained with reference to, on the one hand, the stability of bloc party politics and, on the other, the extent to which centre-right parties have exploited `the immigration issue' as a profiling tool. The findings suggest that even though Denmark has adopted a much tougher stance on immigration and integration compared to Sweden, the political climate in the latter has also undergone a number of changes in the past decade which have allowed centre-right and radical right parties to use immigration to challenge the prevailing cross-party consensus on the issue by suggesting a more market-oriented integration policy.},

Beginning in 1991, instances of attacks on foreigners, their property, and their residences in Germany captured the world's attention. Ranging from firebombing of apartment buildings resulting in the deaths of foreigners to bearings of foreigners, the acts seemed atrocious and unprecedented. Extraordinary social changes occurring in Germany at this time may have provoked such an enormous increase in attacks. German reunification meant that citizens in the east were under pressure to adapt to a new economic and political system and in the process were forced to give up the economic security of the communist system. Although these specific events may be important causes of the increase in right-wing violence, including attacks on foreigners, the purpose of this paper is to explore the systematic causes in an attempt to better explain instances of right-wing violence in Germany. The general explanations of the related phenomenon and support for right-wing parties tend to center around immigration and the economy.},

By making use of large-scale survey data (N = 49,801) together with country-level statistics and expert survey data, we are able to explain extreme right-wing voting behaviour from this multilevel perspective. Our results show that cross-national differences in support of extreme right-wing parties are particularly due to differences in public opinion on immigration and democracy, the number of non-Western residents in a country and, above all, to party characteristics of the extreme right-wing parties themselves.},

In the first part, the available data on extreme right and racist violence in eight Western European countries - Germany, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway - are discussed. Contrary to the image presented in the media, Germany is no 'Sonderfall' as regards the level of violence. Germany belongs to the countries with the highest levels of violence, but Switzerland and Great Britain are roughly comparable in this regard. The second part of the paper attempts to explain cross-national differences by applying two theoretical perspectives from the social movement literature. The grievance model, which sees the causes of violence in grievances related to the main target groups of the extreme right (foreigners and asylum seekers) and more general feelings of anomie among the socially marginal, finds little support in the data. The opportunity model, which emphasizes the role of political elites in shaping mobilization opportunities for social movements, finds support in an analysis of the relation between the development of extreme right and racist violence and the political debate around asylum legislation in Germany. Moreover, cross-national comparison shows that the amount of violence also depends on the prior strength of extreme right and racist parties. Contrary to common wisdom, but in line with the expectations derived from the opportunity model, the level of violence tends to be low where extreme right and racist parties are strong and vice versa.},

The Pegida movement combined fear of `Islamisation' with general criticism of Germany's political class and the mainstream media. This ambivalent and largely undefined political profile proved its strength in mobilising a significant minority of right-wing citizens in the local context of Dresden and the federal state of Saxony, but generally failed to spill over to other parts of Germany. The social profile of the Pegida movement, which included `ordinary citizens' with centre-right to far-right attitudes, points to significant overlap between general disenchantment of the political centre ground in Germany with the political system, as outlined in recent sociological research, and the ability of a largely leaderless populism to mobilise in the streets.},

  abstract = {West European right-wing extremist parties have received a great deal of attention over the past two decades due to their electoral success. What has received less coverage, however, is the fact that these parties have not enjoyed a consistent level of electoral support across Western Europe during this period. This article puts forward an explanation of the variation in the right-wing extremist party vote across Western Europe that incorporates a wider range of factors than have been considered previously. It begins by examining the impact of socio-demographic variables on the right-wing extremist party vote. Then, it turns its attention to a whole host of structural factors that may potentially affect the extreme right party vote, including institutional, party-system and conjunctural variables. The article concludes with an assessment of which variables have the most power in explaining the uneven electoral success of right-wing extremist parties across Western Europe. The findings go some way towards challenging the conventional wisdom as to how the advance of the parties of the extreme right may be halted.},

  abstract = {In this article we develop and test an encompassing theoretical framework for explaining the geographical and temporal spread of extreme right violence. This framework combines structural factors related to ethnic competition, social disintegration, and political opportunity structures, which make certain localities more prone to exhibit ethnic violence, with diffusion variables that determine the degree to which ethnic violence diffuses across time and across localities. We employ an event history analysis of instances of racist violence in 444 German counties for the time period 1990\textendash{}1995. In line with previous research we demonstrate that political opportunities, ethnic competition and social disorganization, media coverage, and the severity of previous violence are significant explanatory factors in the evolution of xenophobic violence. We further find that geographical distance does not affect the diffusion of ethnic violence when controlling for social similarity, which strongly raises the probability of diffusion across localities. This indicates that the effect of geographical distance that is found in many diffusion studies may actually be caused not by geographical proximity as such, but by the fact that proximate areas tend to be socially similar.},

  abstract = {Many previous studies of mass nativism have used abstract psychological explanations or sociological 'micro-theories' to account for public opposition to immigration or support for nativist political movements. On methodological and policy grounds, however, both of these approaches are unsatisfying. This article instead articulates two theories that usually avoid such pitfalls: first, economic self-interest and second, marginality (especially in its cultural version). The study tests these two explanations using public-opinion surveys on opposition to immigration in France, Germany, and the USA and polls on support for the French Front national , the German Republikaner , and California's Proposition 187. Multivariate analysis weakly supports economic self-interest but generally confirms the cultural if not economic form of marginality. These results may suggest that the current battles over immigration have as much to do with whose cultural values will triumph as with whose economic wellbeing will be protected.},

  abstract = {In the early 1990s, Germany went through a difficult debate about changes in its generous asylum laws. Much more dramatic, however, were the increases in the number of violent attacks against foreigners (and also some Germans), mainly by alienated young males. The paper discusses both, the asylum migration and the ethnocentric violence, and also possible connections between the two. In the first part, we present a typology of the perpetrators and various theories which try to explain the new violence, such as: Nazi revival, modernization theory, a theory of civilizational crisis, political culture and dominance culture, and hegemonic masculinity/masculinity crisis. In the second part, we discuss the problems of mass migration and asylum applications, and in particular the debate about it. This debate has contributed indirectly to the violence, although it is not its root cause: through open racism, through scapegoating, and also through a polarization between the two major political camps. In this polarization, different ideological traditions have led to the denial of new dimensions of social reality: the reality of multiculturalism as well as the necessity of limiting and regulating migration. In the final section, we offer a number of suggestions as how to deal with both immigration and violence against foreigners.},

  abstract = {Acts of violence against foreigners, which increased dramatically between 1991 and 1993 in Germany, have triggered an intense discussion about racism, right-wing extremism and counter-culture youth violence. But this discussion has frequently been conducted without regard for the empirical data. This article sets out to bring some of this data into the discourse. Representive opinion polls are employed to show that there is no detectable increase in hostile or ethnocentric attitudes towards foreigners in the German population which could explain the rise of anti-foreigner violence in the early 1990s. Police data on the biographical and socio-demographic characteristics of the perpetrators are analysed to demonstrate that the groups of anti-immigrant and anti-foreigner activists are too heterogeneous to be sweepingly labelled as racists or right-wing extremists. It is emphasised that a specific historial constellation (new waves of immigration; disorienta-tion after German unification) and a sequence of escalating interactions - between police, political parties, segments of the population, the media, right-wing extremists, violence-prone youth groups - have led to an unexpected emergence of violence against foreigners.},

  abstract = {With the dramatic rise in the U.S. Hispanic population, scholars have struggled to explain how race affects welfare state development beyond the Black-White divide. This article uses a comparative analysis of welfare reforms in California and Arizona to examine how anti-Hispanic stereotypes affect social policy formation. Drawing on interviews, archival materials, and newspaper content analysis, I find that animus toward Hispanics is mobilized through two collective action frames: a legality frame and a racial frame. The legality frame lauds the contributions of documented noncitizens while demonizing illegal immigrants. The racial frame celebrates the moral worth of White citizens and uses explicit racial language to deride Hispanics as undeserving. These subtle differences in racialization and worth attribution create divergent political opportunities for welfare policy. When advocates employ the legality frame, they create openings for rights claims by documented noncitizens. Use of the racial frame, however, dampens cross-racial mobilization and effective claims-making for expansive welfare policies. These findings help to explain why the relationship between race and welfare policy is less predictable for Hispanics than for Blacks. They also reveal surprising ways in which race and immigration affect contemporary politics and political mobilization.},
